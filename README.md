# Bubble Blitz

A game where you play as a soap, shoot bubbles at enemies, and try to get the highest possible score before dying to a snail.

## Gameplay

WASD for movement, space to dash, left mouse button (hold) to collect bubbles.

Bubbles only spawn while you are moving. Bubbles that are being held in hand will not collide with enemies! Release the left mouse button to release them. If the bubbles pass over a puddle before colliding with an enemy, they gain special effects.

Enemies spawn in waves, each wave harder than the last. Later waves increase the chance of spawning "champion enemies", which can have higher speed, higher health, or immunity to a random damage type.

Collecting soap particles gives you a bubble and speed boost and a miniscule health increase.
